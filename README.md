# Capris

Previously a [Team Project](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-12/pants-capris), the objective was to build an entire web app while managing merge conflicts. The site consists of a list of available Capris for sale, where you can view individually on a separate page. You also have the History of Capri and a Contact Form.

This is a forked project that I have taken on as a work in progress to build new features.
